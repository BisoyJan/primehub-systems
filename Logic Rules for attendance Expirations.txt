1. check if there is GBRO legible attendance points, that is 60 days already past by before another new attendance points accumulated
2. Then that corresponding attendance points and next record date.
 Example scenarios on Glenda L. Antonio
 Nov 4, 2025
 Aug 8, 2025 -> legible because 60 days already past(check date today) before Nov 4 is added Aug 8 and 7 will be expired
 Aug 7, 2025
 Aug 6, 2025
 Aug 5, 2025
 Aug 4, 2025
-----
 Nov 4, 2025
 Aug 8, 2025 -> set the GBRO Oct 7 2025 both aug 8 and 7

 Nov 4, 2025
 Aug 8, 2025 - Expired(Oct 7 2025) Oct 7 2025 + 60 = December 6, 2025 new GBRO
 now before the next GBRO(which is December 6 2025) is reach the user accumulated another attendance points which is Nov 4 the GBRO will be reset and use the Nov 4 2025 + 60 = Jan 3, 2026(is the next GBRO)
 Aug 7, 2025 - Expired(Oct 7 2025)
 Aug 6, 2025

 Nov 4, 2025 + 60 days = Jan 3, 2026(GBRO Expiration) then the last 2(if only 1 active point is available it will still expire) active points will expired on Jan 3 2026(which is Nov 4, 2025 and Aug 6, 2025)
 Aug 8, 2025 - Expired(Oct 7 2025)
 Aug 7, 2025 - Expired(Oct 7 2025)
 Aug 6, 2025 - Jan 3, 2026(GBRO Expiration)
 Aug 5, 2025
 Aug 4, 2025
-----
if another attendance points accumulated before the Jan 3 2026 is reached(will check date today) then the Jan 3 2026 expiration will be reset and add another 60 days for GBRO rules depending what date the user accumulated attendance points.
3. the expirations always the last 2 active points for GBRO if only 1 remaining eligible GBRO points it will still expire
4. if the user Deletes, Excuse and Edit dates I will also update the GBRO or SRO prediction dates.
5. only show the 2 active points GBRO dates pending for expiration the rest will show not calculated.
6.check first the current structure before proceeding and analyzed what is the best implementation

if you need clarifications or questions let me know
