# PrimeHub Systems - Release Notes
## January 9, 2026 Update

---

## What's New in This Release

This update brings significant improvements to the Leave Management system, better tools for managers and HR, and enhanced user experience across the platform.

---

## 🏖️ Leave Request Improvements

### Smarter Credit Calculations
**What changed:** When you apply for leave in a future month, the system now automatically considers credits you'll earn before your leave starts.

**Example:** If you have 2 credits now and earn 1 credit per month, applying for March leave will show you have 4 credits available (your current 2 + 2 more you'll earn in January and February).

**Benefit:** More accurate leave planning without manual calculations.

---

### Team Scheduling Awareness
**What changed:** When applying for Vacation Leave or Unpaid Time Off, you'll now see a warning if teammates from your campaign have already requested the same dates.

**What you'll see:** A purple alert showing:
- Who else requested time off
- Their leave dates
- Whether their request is approved or pending
- When they submitted their request

**Benefit:** Helps avoid scheduling conflicts and supports fair "first-come, first-served" leave allocation.

---

### 30-Day Absence Window Notice
**What changed:** If you apply for Vacation Leave within 30 days of your last recorded absence, you'll see an informational notice.

**Why this matters:** This helps you understand that your request may receive additional review, and shows you when you'll be eligible for VL without this notice.

**Benefit:** More transparency in the leave approval process.

---

### Partial Leave Approvals (For Managers)
**What changed:** Managers and HR can now approve some days of a leave request while denying others.

**Example:** An employee requests 5 days off, but you can only approve 3 days due to workload. Instead of denying the whole request, you can approve the specific dates that work.

**What approvers will see:**
- A "Partial Deny" button for multi-day requests
- Checkboxes to select which dates to approve
- Required field to explain why some dates were denied

**Benefit:** More flexible leave management without all-or-nothing decisions.

---

### Better Attendance Information (For Reviewers)
**What changed:** When reviewing leave requests, managers now see clearer attendance point information.

**Improvements:**
- Attendance points only highlighted if they're at a concerning level (6 or more)
- New "View Details" button to see breakdown of attendance issues
- Shows whether points were active when the request was submitted

**Benefit:** Helps managers make informed decisions without information overload.

---

## 💰 Leave Credits & Year-End Carryover

### Carryover Credits for Cash Conversion
**What's new:** The system now tracks unused leave credits that can be carried over to the next year for cash conversion.

**How it works:**
- Up to 4 unused credits can be carried over each year
- These credits are for cash conversion only (not for additional leave)
- Credits beyond 4 are forfeited at year-end

**Where to see this:**
- Leave Credits page shows a new "Carryover" column
- Individual credit details page shows carryover breakdown
- Color-coded status: Blue (projected), Amber (pending conversion), Green (converted)

**Benefit:** Clear visibility into year-end benefits and cash conversion eligibility.

---

## 📅 Leave Calendar Updates

### Status-Based Color Coding
**What changed:** The leave calendar now uses different colors for different statuses:

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 🟢 Green | Approved leaves |
| 🟡 Yellow | Pending leaves |
| 🟢🟡 Gradient | Both approved and pending |

**New filter:** You can now filter the calendar to show only Approved, only Pending, or All requests.

**Benefit:** Easier to see at a glance which days have confirmed vs. pending absences.

---

## 🗄️ Data Retention Improvements

### Record Statistics Dashboard
**What's new:** Administrators can now see statistics about how many records exist and their age:
- Leave Requests
- IT Concerns
- Medication Requests
- Leave Credits

**Benefit:** Helps plan data cleanup and storage management.

---

### Preview Before Cleanup
**What's new:** Before enforcing a retention policy, you can now preview exactly how many records would be deleted.

**What you'll see:**
- Total number of affected records
- Breakdown by record type
- Date range of affected records

**Benefit:** No surprises when cleanup runs - you know exactly what will happen.

---

### Leave Credit Retention
**What's new:** Retention policies can now be configured specifically for leave credit records, separate from other form requests.

**Benefit:** More granular control over how long different types of data are kept.

---

## 🔔 Notifications

### Improved Reliability
**What changed:** System notifications are now more reliable with improved backend communication.

**Benefit:** Fewer missed notifications and more consistent delivery.

---

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

**What's new:** When something goes wrong (page not found, access denied, etc.), you'll see a friendlier, more helpful error page with:
- Clear explanation of what happened
- Helpful navigation options
- Interactive animated background
- Rotating inspirational quotes

**Benefit:** Less frustrating experience when errors occur.

---

### Header Date & Time
**What's new:** The application header now shows the current date and time (except on the dashboard).

**Benefit:** Easy time reference while working in the system.

---

## 🔧 Behind the Scenes

### Automatic Year-End Processing
**What's new:** The system will automatically process leave credit carryovers on January 1st each year.

**What happens:**
- Calculates unused credits from the previous year
- Carries over up to 4 credits for cash conversion
