# Attendance Point Expiration Rules

## Overview
Attendance points automatically expire based on two different mechanisms: Standard Roll Off (SRO) and Good Behavior Roll Off (GBRO). This system encourages good attendance while maintaining accountability.

---

## Expiration Types

### 1. Standard Roll Off (SRO)
**Automatic expiration after a set period from the violation date**

#### Rules:
- **Standard Violations**: 6 months expiration
  - Tardy (0.25 points)
  - Undertime (0.25 points)  
  - Half-Day Absence (0.50 points)

- **NCNS/FTN**: 1 year expiration  
  - No Call, No Show - NCNS (1.00 point)
  - Failed to Notify - FTN (1.00 point)

#### How It Works:
```
Violation Date: Jan 1, 2025
└─ Standard Violation → Expires: Jul 1, 2025 (6 months)
└─ NCNS/FTN → Expires: Jan 1, 2026 (12 months)
```

#### Characteristics:
- ✅ Fully automatic
- ✅ Based solely on violation date
- ✅ No user action required
- ✅ Runs daily via scheduled command

---

### 2. Good Behavior Roll Off (GBRO)
**Reward for sustained good attendance behavior**

#### Rules:
- **Eligibility**: No violations for **60 consecutive days**
- **Benefit**: Last **2 violation points** are automatically removed
- **Exclusions**: NCNS/FTN points are **NOT eligible** for GBRO

#### Example Scenario:
```
Employee Violations:
├─ Nov 4:  0.25 pts (Tardy)
├─ Nov 5:  0.25 pts (Tardy)
└─ Nov 6:  0.50 pts (Half-Day Absence)

After 60 days of perfect attendance:
├─ Nov 4:  0.25 pts (Remains - oldest)
├─ Nov 5:  0.25 pts (REMOVED via GBRO) ✨
└─ Nov 6:  0.50 pts (REMOVED via GBRO) ✨

Result: 0.50 points removed, 0.25 remaining
```

#### How It Works:
1. System identifies users with no violations in last 60 days
2. Finds the **2 most recent** points that are:
   - Active (not expired, not excused)
   - Eligible for GBRO (not NCNS/FTN)
3. Marks those points as expired with type "GBRO"
4. Employee gets fresh start while maintaining some accountability

#### Characteristics:
- ✅ Rewards consistent good behavior
- ✅ Automatic after 60 days clean
- ⛔ Cannot remove NCNS/FTN points
- ✅ Removes most recent 2 points only
- ✅ Can be applied multiple times (60 days each)

## Database Schema

### New Fields in `attendance_points`

```sql
-- Expiration tracking
expires_at           DATE           -- Calculated expiration date
expiration_type      ENUM           -- 'sro', 'gbro', 'none'
is_expired           BOOLEAN        -- Whether point has expired
expired_at           DATE           -- When it was marked expired

-- Violation details
violation_details    TEXT           -- Human-readable description
tardy_minutes        INTEGER        -- Minutes late (for tardy)
undertime_minutes    INTEGER        -- Minutes left early

-- GBRO tracking
eligible_for_gbro    BOOLEAN        -- Can this be removed by GBRO?
gbro_applied_at      DATE           -- When GBRO was applied
gbro_batch_id        VARCHAR(255)   -- Batch processing ID
```

---

## Automated Processing

### Artisan Command
```bash
# Run expiration processing
php artisan points:process-expirations

# Dry run (see what would happen without changes)
php artisan points:process-expirations --dry-run
```

### Scheduled Task (✅ Configured)
Automatically configured in `app/Console/Kernel.php`:
```php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    // Process attendance point expirations (SRO and GBRO) - runs daily at 3:00 AM
    $schedule->command('points:process-expirations')
        ->dailyAt('03:00')
        ->withoutOverlapping()
        ->onOneServer();
}
```

**Schedule Details:**
- **Frequency:** Daily at 3:00 AM
- **Prevents:** Overlapping executions with `withoutOverlapping()`
- **Multi-server:** Only runs on one server with `onOneServer()`
- **Output:** Console output with summary table showing:
  - SRO expirations processed
  - GBRO expirations processed
  - Users affected
  - Processing timestamp

**To enable automatic execution:**
- Ensure Laravel scheduler is running via cron:
  ```bash
  * * * * * cd /path-to-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
  ```
- Or on Windows Task Scheduler, run every minute:
  ```bash
  php artisan schedule:run
  ```

### What the Command Does:

#### SRO Processing:
1. Finds all non-expired, non-excused points
2. Checks if `expires_at` <= today
3. Marks matching points as expired with type "sro"

#### GBRO Processing:
1. Gets all users with active points
2. For each user:
   - Finds most recent violation date
   - Calculates days since last violation
   - If ≥ 60 days:
     - Gets 2 most recent GBRO-eligible points
     - Marks them expired with type "gbro"
     - Records GBRO batch ID for tracking

  - Current status badge (Active/Excused/Expired SRO/Expired GBRO)
  - Expired date (if already expired)
- **Excuse information** (if point was excused):
  - Excuse reason
  - Who excused it
  - When it was excused

#### Desktop Table View:
- **8 columns:** Employee, Date, Type, Points, Status, Violation Details, Expires, Actions
- **Violation Details column:** Shows "View Details" button (no text clutter)
- **Expires column:** Shows expiration date with countdown or expired date
- **Visual distinction:** Expired rows have reduced opacity

## Business Logic Examples

### Example 1: Standard Violations
```
Employee: John Doe

Jan 15, 2025 - Tardy (12 min)
├─ Points: 0.25
├─ Expires: Jul 15, 2025 (6 months)
├─ GBRO Eligible: Yes
└─ Status: Active

Feb 1, 2025 - NCNS
├─ Points: 1.00
├─ Expires: Feb 1, 2026 (1 year)
├─ GBRO Eligible: No
└─ Status: Active

Total Active Points: 1.25
```

### Example 2: GBRO Application
```
Employee: Jane Smith

Oct 1, 2024 - Tardy
├─ Points: 0.25
├─ Status: Active

Oct 5, 2024 - Undertime
├─ Points: 0.25
├─ Status: Active

Oct 10, 2024 - Half-Day Absence
├─ Points: 0.50
├─ Status: Active

60 days of perfect attendance...

Dec 15, 2024 - GBRO Triggered!
├─ Oct 10 point (0.50) → Expired via GBRO ✨
├─ Oct 5 point (0.25) → Expired via GBRO ✨
└─ Oct 1 point (0.25) → Remains active

New Total: 0.25 points (was 1.00)
```

### Example 3: Mixed Scenario
```
Employee: Mike Johnson

May 1, 2025 - NCNS (Not advised)
├─ Points: 1.00
├─ Expires: May 1, 2026
├─ GBRO Eligible: No

May 15, 2025 - Tardy
├─ Points: 0.25
├─ Expires: Nov 15, 2025
├─ GBRO Eligible: Yes

June 1, 2025 - Undertime
├─ Points: 0.25
├─ Expires: Dec 1, 2025
├─ GBRO Eligible: Yes

After 60 days clean (Aug 1, 2025):
├─ NCNS (1.00) → Remains (not GBRO eligible)
├─ Undertime (0.25) → Expired via GBRO ✨
├─ Tardy (0.25) → Expired via GBRO ✨

Final Total: 1.00 point (NCNS only)
```
