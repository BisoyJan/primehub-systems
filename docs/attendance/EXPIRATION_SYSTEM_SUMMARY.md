# Attendance Point Expiration System - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview

A fully automated attendance point expiration system that implements **Standard Roll Off (SRO)** and **Good Behavior Roll Off (GBRO)** rules to manage employee attendance accountability fairly while encouraging good behavior.

**Status:** ✅ **PRODUCTION READY** - Fully implemented backend and frontend

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Standard Roll Off (SRO)
**Automatic expiration based on time elapsed since violation**

- **Standard violations** (Tardy, Undertime, Half-Day) expire after **6 months**
- **NCNS/FTN violations** expire after **1 year**
- Fully automatic, runs daily at 3:00 AM
- No user intervention required

### 2. Good Behavior Roll Off (GBRO)
**Reward system for sustained good attendance**

- After **60 consecutive days** without violations
- Automatically expires the **last 2 eligible points**
- NCNS/FTN points are **NOT eligible** for GBRO
- Encourages and rewards good attendance behavior

### 3. Comprehensive Violation Details
**Each point includes detailed information:**

- Full violation description (e.g., "Tardy: Arrived 12 minutes late. Scheduled: 07:00, Actual: 07:12")
- Tardy/undertime duration in minutes
- Scheduled vs actual times
- NCNS/FTN indicators
- Auto-generated during attendance processing

### 4. Clean Frontend UI
**User-friendly interface with dialog-based details:**

- "View Details" buttons instead of cluttered table text
- Comprehensive violation details dialog
- Expiration date with countdown ("X days remaining")
- Status badges: Active / Excused / Expired (SRO) / Expired (GBRO)
- Visual distinction for expired points (reduced opacity)
- Mobile-responsive design

## 🔄 Automated Processing

**Scheduled Task Details:**
```php
// app/Console/Kernel.php
$schedule->command('points:process-expirations')
    ->dailyAt('03:00')
    ->withoutOverlapping()
    ->onOneServer();
```

**Processing Flow:**

**1. SRO Processing:**
   - Find all non-expired, non-excused points
   - Check if `expires_at` <= today
   - Mark as expired with type 'sro'
   - Set `expired_at` to current date

**2. GBRO Processing:**
   - Get all users with active points
   - For each user:
     - Find most recent violation date
     - Calculate days since last violation
     - If ≥ 60 days:
       - Get 2 most recent GBRO-eligible points
       - Mark as expired with type 'gbro'
       - Assign batch ID for tracking
       - Set `gbro_applied_at`

**Output Summary:**
```

## 💡 Business Logic Examples

### Example 1: GBRO Success
```
Employee: Sarah Johnson

Points before GBRO:
├─ Oct 1  - Tardy (0.25) ← oldest
├─ Oct 5  - Undertime (0.25)
├─ Oct 10 - Half-Day (0.50) ← most recent eligible
└─ Total: 1.00 points

After 60 clean days (Dec 10):
├─ Oct 10 (0.50) → Expired via GBRO ✨
├─ Oct 5  (0.25) → Expired via GBRO ✨
├─ Oct 1  (0.25) → Remains active
└─ New Total: 0.25 points
```

### Example 2: NCNS Not GBRO Eligible
```
Employee: Mike Chen

Points:
├─ Nov 1 - NCNS (1.00) ← NOT eligible for GBRO
├─ Nov 5 - Tardy (0.25)
└─ Nov 8 - Undertime (0.25)

After 60 clean days:
├─ NCNS stays (not GBRO eligible)
├─ Nov 8 Undertime → Expired via GBRO ✨
├─ Nov 5 Tardy → Expired via GBRO ✨
└─ Final: 1.00 (NCNS only)
```

### Example 3: Mixed Expirations
```
Employee: Lisa Rodriguez

Timeline:
├─ May 1  - Tardy (0.25)
│           Expires: Nov 1 (6 months) ← SRO
├─ May 15 - NCNS (1.00)
│           Expires: May 15, 2026 (1 year)
├─ June 1 - Undertime (0.25)
│           Expires: Dec 1 (6 months)

Result on Nov 1:
├─ May 1 Tardy → Expired via SRO ✨
├─ NCNS remains (long expiration)
├─ June 1 Undertime remains
└─ Total: 1.25 points

If 60 days clean after Nov 1:
├─ NCNS remains (not GBRO eligible)
├─ June 1 Undertime → Expired via GBRO ✨
└─ Final: 1.00 (NCNS only)
```
