## NEXT STEPS

Once you've checked the boxes above:

1. **Save this file** with your decisions
2. **Share it back** - I'll implement the exact permissions you specified
3. I'll update:
   - ✅ Backend routes with middleware
   - ✅ Frontend pages with authorization components
   - ✅ Sidebar navigation filtering
   - ✅ Config/permissions.php (if needed)

**Tips:**
- `Super Admin` should probably have access to everything
- `Admin` typically has most features except system-level settings
- `HR` focuses on attendance, schedules, and leave
- `IT` focuses on hardware, PCs, and infrastructure
- `Agent` typically has read-only access
- `Team Lead` is a middle-ground between Agent and Admin
