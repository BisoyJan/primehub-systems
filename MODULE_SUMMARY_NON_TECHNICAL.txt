needs your attention today.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. USER ACCOUNTS & ACCESS
-------------------------

 Module Overview
This is the "front door" of the system. It handles who can log in, what they
can see, and what they can do. It ensures that everyone has the right level
of access based on their job role.

 Key Features
- Secure Login: Password-protected access for every user.

Q: Why can't I see the "Delete" button?
A: Your role likely doesn't have permission to delete items to prevent accidents.

Q: What happens when an employee leaves the company?
A: An admin deactivates their account, which revokes access but keeps
   historical records intact.

 Final Takeaway
The User Accounts module keeps the system secure and organized by ensuring
the right people have the right access.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. COMPUTER & HARDWARE INVENTORY
--------------------------------

 Module Overview
Think of this as a digital library for all our physical equipment. It tracks
every computer, monitor, and component (like RAM and hard drives) owned by
the company.

 Key Features
- PC Specifications: Detailed records of what's inside every computer.
- Hardware Components: Separate tracking for RAM, Disks, Processors, and Monitors.
- Stock Inventory: Tracks spare parts available in the storage room.
- Maintenance Logs: Keeps a history of repairs and upgrades for each machine.

 Benefits
- Cost Savings: Prevents unnecessary purchases by knowing exactly what we have.
- Efficiency: IT can quickly find compatible parts for repairs.
- History: We know the full life story of every computer, from purchase to retirement.

 How It Works
Every computer is entered into the system with its details (processor, memory,
etc.). When a part is taken from stock to fix a PC, the system updates the
inventory automatically. If a PC moves to a new desk, its location is updated.

 Common Questions
Q: Does this track my personal laptop?
A: No, only company-owned assets are tracked.

Q: How do I know if we have spare monitors?
A: The Stock Inventory section shows a live count of all available items.

Q: What if my computer is slow?
A: Report it via IT Concerns. IT will check the system to see your PC's specs
   and maintenance history.

 Final Takeaway
This module eliminates the guesswork in managing expensive hardware, ensuring
equipment is accounted for and well-maintained.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. WORKSTATION MANAGEMENT
-------------------------

 Module Overview
This module maps out the physical layout of our office. It manages "Stations"
(desks/cubicles) and organizes them by "Sites" (office locations) and
"Campaigns" (teams/projects).

 Key Features
- Station Mapping: Assigns a unique number to every physical desk.
- Site & Campaign Organization: Groups stations by floor, building, or project team.
- Occupancy Tracking: Shows which stations are currently in use.
- Bulk Creation: Add many stations at once (e.g., "create stations 1-50").

 Primary Functions (What You Can Do)
- Create Station: Add a new desk number to the digital office map.
- Assign Campaign: Link a group of stations to a specific project team.
- View Occupancy: Check which stations have computers or users assigned.
- Manage Sites: Organize stations into different physical locations (e.g., "Building A").
- Bulk Create: Add multiple stations in one action.

 Who Uses This
- Super Admin, IT: Full access (create, edit, delete stations)
- Admin: View stations only
- Other Roles: No direct access

 Benefits
- Organization: Makes it easy to find where someone sits.
- Planning: Helps managers plan seating arrangements for new teams.
- Asset Tracking: Links computers to specific physical locations.

 How It Works
Imagine a map of the office. Each desk is a "Station." We can label a group
of stations as "Customer Support Team." When we put a computer on a desk,
we link that PC to that Station number in the system.

 Common Questions
Q: What is a "Station"?
A: It's simply a specific desk or workspace in the office.

Q: Can a station belong to two campaigns?
A: Typically, a station is assigned to one primary campaign or team at a time.

Q: What is a "Site"?
A: A Site is a physical location like "Main Office" or "Building B, 3rd Floor."

 Final Takeaway
Workstation Management turns the physical office layout into a digital map,
helping us manage space and resources effectively.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. ATTENDANCE & TIMEKEEPING
---------------------------

 Module Overview
This is the digital time clock. It records when employees start and end their
shifts, tracks lateness, and manages attendance points. It connects with
biometric scanners (fingerprint/face ID).

 Key Features
- Biometric Integration: Automatically pulls data from door scanners.
- Shift Detection: Recognizes 48+ different shift patterns automatically.
- Points System: Tracks attendance infractions (like being late) with a points system.
- Real-Time Logs: Shows who is in the building right now.
- Calendar View: See attendance history in a familiar calendar format.
- Data Import: Upload attendance files from external sources.

 Primary Functions (What You Can Do)
- Process Logs: (System) Automatically imports and matches biometric data.
- View My Attendance: Employees can check their own daily logs and points.
- Monitor Attendance: Managers can see who is present, late, or absent in real-time.
- Review Records: HR can verify and approve attendance entries.
- Import Data: Upload attendance files manually if needed.

 Who Uses This
- Super Admin, Admin, HR: Full access (view all, import, verify, approve)
- Team Lead: View team attendance, import data
- Agent, Utility: View own attendance only

 Benefits
- Fairness: Ensures everyone's time is tracked accurately and impartially.
- Automation: Reduces manual data entry for payroll and HR.
- Transparency: Employees can see their own attendance records and points.

 How It Works
When you scan your finger or badge at the door, the system records the time.
It compares this to your scheduled shift. If you are late, it flags it. It
also calculates "points" based on company policy for absences or tardiness.

 Common Questions
Q: What happens if I forget to scan out?
A: The system may flag it as a "missing log," and you might need to file a
   correction request through HR.

Q: How are points calculated?
A: Points are automatically added based on rules (e.g., 1 point for late,
   2 for absence) defined by HR.

Q: Can I see my own attendance history?
A: Yes! Every employee can view their own records in the Attendance section.

 Final Takeaway
The Attendance module automates the complex task of tracking time, ensuring
accurate payroll and fair enforcement of attendance policies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. BIOMETRIC RECORDS
--------------------

 Module Overview
This is the "raw data" behind attendance. Every time you scan your finger or
face at the door, a record is created here. Think of it as the "receipt"
before the system processes it into attendance.

 Key Features
- Raw Scan Storage: Keeps every biometric scan as-is for auditing.
- Anomaly Detection: Flags unusual patterns (e.g., scanning in twice without scanning out).
- Reprocessing: Re-run the matching algorithm if errors occurred.
- Data Retention: Automatic cleanup of old records per company policy.

 Primary Functions (What You Can Do)
- View Records: See the raw biometric data before it becomes attendance.
- Detect Anomalies: Identify problematic scan patterns.
- Reprocess Data: Fix matching errors by rerunning the algorithm.
- Export Data: Download records for external analysis or audits.
- Manage Retention: Set how long old records are kept.

 Who Uses This
- Super Admin, Admin, HR: Full access
- Team Lead: View and reprocess only
- Other Roles: No access

 Benefits
- Audit Trail: Provides proof of the original scan data if disputes arise.
- Error Correction: Problems can be fixed without losing original data.
- Compliance: Meets record-keeping requirements for labor regulations.

 How It Works
The biometric scanner sends raw data (like "Employee #45 scanned at 8:02 AM").
The system stores this raw record, then processes it to create an attendance
entry. If something goes wrong, HR can look at the raw record and reprocess it.

 Common Questions
Q: Why are there separate "Biometric Records" and "Attendance" sections?
A: Biometric Records are the raw scans; Attendance is the processed result.
   Keeping both allows for error correction and auditing.

Q: What is an "anomaly"?
A: An unusual pattern, like scanning in at 8 AM, then again at 8:05 AM
   without scanning out. It might indicate a scanner error or forgotten scan.

 Final Takeaway
Biometric Records provide the audit trail and raw data that makes attendance
tracking trustworthy and correctable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. EMPLOYEE SCHEDULES
---------------------

 Module Overview
This module defines when employees are expected to work. It sets up shift
patterns so the system knows if you're early, on-time, or late.

 Key Features
- Shift Definitions: Create different work schedules (e.g., 9 AM - 6 PM).
- Employee Assignment: Link specific schedules to specific employees.
- Active/Inactive Toggle: Turn schedules on or off as needed.
- Flexible Patterns: Supports various shift types (day, night, rotating).

 Primary Functions (What You Can Do)
- Create Schedule: Define a new shift pattern with start and end times.
- Assign Employees: Link employees to their work schedules.
- Edit Schedule: Modify shift times when business needs change.
- Toggle Status: Activate or deactivate schedules temporarily.

 Who Uses This
- Super Admin, Admin, HR, Team Lead: Full access
- Agent, Utility: View own schedule only (indirectly through attendance)

 Benefits
- Accuracy: The system knows exactly when you should arrive.
- Fairness: Everyone is measured against their assigned schedule.
- Flexibility: Different teams can have different work hours.

 How It Works
HR creates a schedule called "Day Shift" (9 AM to 6 PM). They assign John,
Mary, and Carlos to this schedule. Now when John scans in at 9:15 AM, the
system knows he's 15 minutes late because it compares his scan to his
assigned schedule.

 Common Questions
Q: What if I work different hours on different days?
A: Multiple schedules can be created and assigned as needed.

Q: Who decides my schedule?
A: Typically HR or your Team Lead, with management approval.

 Final Takeaway
Schedules are the foundation for fair attendance tracking—they define the
"rules of the game" for everyone.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. ATTENDANCE POINTS
--------------------

 Module Overview
This is the disciplinary tracking system for attendance. When you're late or
absent without approval, "points" are added to your record. Think of it like
a traffic ticket system for time and attendance.

 Key Features
- Automatic Points: The system calculates points based on attendance events.
- Manual Points: HR can add or remove points for special cases.
- Point Expiration: Old points expire after a set period (e.g., rolling year).
- Excuse Points: HR can "excuse" points for valid reasons (medical emergency, etc.).
- Threshold Alerts: Warnings when employees approach disciplinary thresholds.

 Primary Functions (What You Can Do)
- View Points: See your current point balance and history.
- Add Manual Points: (HR only) Record infractions not caught automatically.
- Excuse Points: (HR only) Remove points for excused absences.
- Export Reports: Download point summaries for review.
- Rescan: Recalculate points if attendance was corrected.

 Who Uses This
- Super Admin, Admin, HR: Full access (view all, add, excuse, export)
- Team Lead: View team points, add manual points
- Agent, Utility: View own points only

 Benefits
- Consistency: Same rules apply to everyone, enforced by the system.
- Transparency: Employees can see exactly why they have points.
- Documentation: Creates a clear record for performance discussions.

 How It Works
Let's say company policy is: 1 point for being late, 2 points for unexcused
absence. If you're late on Monday and absent Tuesday, you get 3 points.
Points might expire after 12 months, so old infractions don't follow you forever.

 Common Questions
Q: How many points is too many?
A: This depends on company policy (e.g., 10 points = verbal warning,
   20 points = written warning).

Q: Can points be removed?
A: Yes, HR can "excuse" points if you have a valid reason (like a doctor's note).

Q: Do points ever go away on their own?
A: Yes, points typically expire after a set period (like one year).

 Final Takeaway
The Points system ensures fair and consistent enforcement of attendance
policies across the entire organization.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16. GETTING HELP & SUPPORT
--------------------------

 Having Trouble?

For Technical Issues (system not working, errors, slow performance):
1. Submit an IT Concern through the system (if accessible).
2. Contact the IT department directly.

For Access Issues (can't log in, missing permissions):
1. Contact your manager or HR.
2. Admins can reset passwords and adjust permissions.

For Process Questions (how to file leave, attendance policy):
1. Check this guide first.
2. Ask your Team Lead or HR representative.

 Tips for Getting Help Faster
- Be Specific: "The leave request form won't submit" is better than "it's broken."
- Include Details: What were you trying to do? What error did you see?
- Screenshot: A picture is worth a thousand words.

 System Requirements
- Web Browser: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge (latest versions).
- Mobile: Works on smartphones and tablets through the web browser.
- Internet: Requires active internet connection.
